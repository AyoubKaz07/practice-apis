# practice-apis
Basic products API


Test it out:
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- connect to MongoDB database (if you don't have, make one... until i learn deploying)
- the route is : `localhost:port/api/v1/products`
## this was just to practice querying data 
( data was added to the db from `products.json` (look at populate.js)

### Thanks to the goat John Smilga
